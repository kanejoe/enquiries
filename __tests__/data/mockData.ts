          "“A bit bruised,” was how Eddie Howe described his team in the aftermath. And while he was careful not to make excuses, it was clear that the exertions of their last five games – all bruising in their own ways – are beginning to erode not just the quality of players at his disposal but the burning intensity required to perform at their best. This is a squad reduced to 13 senior outfield players and, with Callum Wilson forced off at half-time with a tight hamstring, very possibly lacking a fit striker.",

Perhaps the most telling indicator of this was the first goal, which resulted from Dortmund inexplicably winning three loose balls in a row on the edge of the Newcastle area. Marcel Sabitzer gratefully gathered the last and rolled it across for Niclas Füllkrug to finish high into the net. When Howe posited afterwards that he didn’t “think Dortmund have seen the best Newcastle”, this was probably the kind of thing he meant.",
